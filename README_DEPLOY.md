## üì§ Quick Fix for Streamlit Cloud Deployment

### Problem:
Model file is too large for GitHub (111 MB > 100 MB limit)

### ‚úÖ Solution: Host model on Google Drive

### Steps:

**1. Upload Model to Google Drive:**
   - Upload: `dogs_vs_cats_production_model.keras`
   - Right-click ‚Üí Share ‚Üí "Anyone with the link"
   - Copy the link

**2. Get File ID:**
   From this URL:
   ```
   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ABC123XYZ789/view?usp=sharing
   ```
   Copy the FILE_ID part: `1ABC123XYZ789`

**3. Update streamlit_app.py:**
   Line 52, replace:
   ```python
   model_url = "https://drive.google.com/uc?id=YOUR_FILE_ID_HERE"
   ```
   With:
   ```python
   model_url = "https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ABC123XYZ789"
   ```

**4. Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Google Drive model download"
   git push
   ```

**5. Streamlit will auto-redeploy** and download the model on first run!

### üìù What Changed:
- ‚úÖ Added `gdown` to requirements.txt (for downloading from Google Drive)
